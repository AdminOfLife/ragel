I'm writing to submit a small errata:   while compiling generated code with the default C++ binary search based lookup using Visual C++ with 64 bit address model, the compiler correctly warns about some pointer arithmetic where the difference between pointers, of type ptrdiff_t which is 64 bits, is added - e.g.  "     _trans += (_mid - _keys); "    Clearly this won't lead to any problems in practice, but it would be nice to eliminate the warnings with an explicit cast.
