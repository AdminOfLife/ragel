As it stands, conditions are implemented by expanding to values in the alphabet. This causes the alphabet to grow and makes it impossible to use conditions with long-sized alphabets (no space left). It is also a confusing implementation.

We should instead be representing transition on character as a the usual list, instead of a single transtion in the TransAp struct we should have a list of transitions for each active condition expression. Most of this time will be on the no-condition set.
