Reported by Austin Hastings. Win32 build only.

<pre>
===== testinc.rl =====
%%{
machine inner;
one = "one";
two = "two";
}%%
===== test.rl =====
%%{
    machine test;
    include inner "testinc.rl";

    main := one;
}%%
===== =====

When I have test.rl and testinc.rl in the same directory, I can do

    ragel test.rl

with no problems. When I move testinc.rl to a different directory:

    mkdir x
    mv testinc.rl x
    ragel test.rl

I get errors (as expected):

test.rl:3:28: include: failed to locate file
test.rl:3:28: include: attempted: "testinc.rl"
test.rl:5:10: graph lookup of "one" failed

When I then specify the include path:

    ragel -I x test.rl

I get:

$ ragel -I x test.rl
test.rl:5:10: graph lookup of "one" failed

Apparently ragel now finds the included file okay, but for some reason the exact same file which worked before has problems with finding the "one" tag.

What am I doing wrong, or is this a bug?
